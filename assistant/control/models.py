"""Data model for the JARVIS control plane.

These are the concepts the whole system coordinates around: the user's goals
(Task) broken into observable steps (TaskStep), the machines and AI helpers
that carry them out (Device, Helper), the access those helpers are granted
(Permission), the decisions the user must make (Approval), and the readable
record of what happened (ActivityEvent).

The types are plain dataclasses so they can cross any boundary - SQLite rows,
JSON for the desktop and mobile clients, or the in-process event bus - without
dragging a framework along with them.
