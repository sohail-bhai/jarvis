"""Decides which events are worth interrupting a person for, and delivers them.

The timeline records everything. A notification is different: it goes to a
phone that may be in someone's pocket, so the bar is higher. Only things a
person would want to know about while away from the computer are sent -
approvals waiting on them, work that finished or failed, an agent that went
wrong, a security event.

Channels are injectable and failures are contained: a broken channel must
never stop the work that produced the event.
