"""Your computer's files, reachable from your phone, without opening the lot.

The rule this module exists to enforce: a phone on the other side of the
country can reach exactly the folders you shared, and nothing else. Every path
that arrives from outside is resolved to a real location on disk and checked
against those shares before anything is opened, so `../../.ssh` and a symlink
pointing at `/etc` both fail the same way.

Sharing is opt-in. With no shares configured, the answer to every request is
"nothing is shared yet".
