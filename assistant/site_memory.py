"""What JARVIS learned about a website last time.

The second visit to a site should not start from nothing. When a flow works -
"the issues list is under /-/issues", "the search box is element 3", "this one
needs a login first" - it is written down against the domain and handed back
the next time that domain is opened.

Notes are keyed by domain rather than searched by meaning, because "which site
am I on" is an exact question. A small JSON file is enough, and it works with
no model and no network.
