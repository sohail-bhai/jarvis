"""Tests for finishing a request that is made of several actions.

"Open Netflix and open any profile" opened Netflix and stopped. Two things in
the loop caused that, and both are pinned down here:

* Any tool call identical to the previous one was treated as an infinite loop,
  and the model was told to give up. Looking twice in a row is how the work is
  actually done - click something, then list the page again to see what
  changed - so a chain died on its second look.
* A request was over as soon as the model produced words, however much of it
  was still undone.

Nothing here talks to Ollama or to the desktop: the model is a scripted
sequence of replies, and the tools are recorded rather than run.
