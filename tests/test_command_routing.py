"""Tests for command routing and the atomic desktop toolkit.

Two things are pinned down here. First, that ending the session is a decision
about the whole utterance: "stop overwatch" and "exit fullscreen" are ordinary
instructions, and treating the bare word "stop" as a shutdown used to kill the
assistant mid-task. Second, that the atomic tools a task gets chained from -
key combinations, waiting, window handling - behave predictably, since every
goal without a purpose-built tool is carried out by composing these.

The keyboard and window tests drive no real input; they check the translation
and clamping that happens before the OS is touched.
