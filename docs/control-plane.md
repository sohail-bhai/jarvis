# JARVIS Control Plane

The control plane is the part of JARVIS that coordinates work. It accepts a
goal in plain language, breaks it into observable steps, picks an AI helper by
what that helper can do, grants narrow and time-limited access, holds
consequential actions until the user approves them, and records a readable
trail of everything that happened.

It is deliberately separate from voice, the desktop UI and the AI brain, so
every client sees the same state.

```
Desktop app (Windows / macOS / Linux)     Mobile client
                    \                        /
                     \                      /
                      HTTP + WebSocket API
                              |
                        Control plane
                              |
                       SQLite (data/control.db)
```

## Why a service boundary

The desktop app and the mobile interface are built by different people. If
coordination logic lived inside the desktop UI, the phone could not reach it.
Putting it behind an API means:

- the desktop app is a thin client and can be rewritten freely,
- the mobile client gets the same capabilities with no duplicated logic,
- tasks, approvals and activity stay consistent across both.

## Modules

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `assistant/control/models.py` | The data model: `Task`, `TaskStep`, `Helper`, `Device`, `Permission`, `Approval`, `ActivityEvent`, plus their status enums. Plain dataclasses with no framework dependency. |
| `assistant/control/store.py` | SQLite persistence. The only module that knows SQL, so moving to PostgreSQL later means rewriting this file alone. |
| `assistant/control/service.py` | `ControlPlane` — the coordination logic and the only thing clients need. |
| `assistant/control/secrets.py` | Credentials, encrypted at rest. Agents get references; only the plane resolves them. |
| `assistant/control/notifier.py` | Decides which events are worth interrupting a person for, and delivers them. |
| `assistant/control/planner.py` | Turns a goal into steps, with a model call that can be injected. |
| `assistant/control/adapters.py` | How the control plane talks to an agent: in-process, over HTTP, or something added later. |
| `assistant/control/capabilities.py` | The catalog of namespaced capabilities and the risk each one carries. |
| `assistant/control/policy.py` | `PolicyEngine` - allow, ask or deny, from risk defaults and stored rules. |
| `assistant/control/executor.py` | `TaskExecutor` - runs a task's steps through the AI brain and writes the outcomes back. |
| `assistant/api/app.py` | FastAPI HTTP + WebSocket boundary. |
| `assistant/api/auth.py` | Device pairing, token authentication and rate limiting. |
| `assistant/api/errors.py` | One error envelope for every failure. |

## Core concepts

**Task** — a goal in the user's own words, with **steps** phrased so a person
can read them ("Finding relevant files"). Progress is derived from how many
steps are done, so no client has to compute it.

Steps form a graph. A plain list of labels is a sequence, because that is what
a caller listing steps means; a step that names `depends_on` opts into running
alongside its siblings:

```python
plane.create_task("Prepare the weekly report", steps=[
    {"label": "Fetch the data", "depends_on": []},
    {"label": "Fetch the template", "depends_on": []},
    {"label": "Write the report", "depends_on": [0, 1]},
])
```

The two fetches run at the same time; the write waits for both. At most three
steps run at once by default - these steps drive one computer, and a local
model is the bottleneck.

**Agent** (`Helper` in the code, `/api/agents` over HTTP) — an AI worker that
advertises capabilities and reports how it is doing. Callers ask for a
capability, never for an agent by name:

```python
plane.create_task("Look this up", capability="research")
```

An agent that is offline, disabled or quarantined is never selected.

Agents carry a version, an endpoint, free-form metadata, and health that is
observed rather than guessed - heartbeats say it is alive, while the success
and error counts and the latencies come from work that actually ran:

```python
plane.heartbeat(agent.id, latency_ms=250, ok=True)
plane.agent_health()
# [{"name": "Research agent", "status": "idle", "error_rate": 0.0,
#   "p95_latency_ms": 250, ...}]
```

An agent that has reported and then goes quiet for 90 seconds is marked
offline; one that has never reported is left alone, because silence from
something that never spoke proves nothing. Devices work the same way with a
five-minute window, and this computer is never swept offline.

**Adapters** — an agent is a capability and an address, not a framework.
`NativeAdapter` runs the step in this process through the JARVIS agent loop;
`HttpAdapter` posts `{"instruction", "context"}` to the agent's endpoint and
reads `{"output"}` back. An unknown framework falls back to running locally, so
MCP, LangGraph or a containerised agent can join later without the
orchestrator learning anything about them.

**Stopping an agent** — `plane.kill_helper(id)` cancels the task it was
working on, revokes every grant it holds, disables it and quarantines it, in
one step. Other agents' grants are untouched. Nothing is deleted: the timeline
still shows what it did before it was stopped. `set_helper_enabled(id, False)`
is the gentler version - no new work, history intact.

**Capability** — a namespaced thing an agent may ask to do, such as
`google.gmail.read`, `browser.navigate` or `gcp.cloud_run.deploy`. Every
capability carries a risk level, and unknown names are treated as critical so a
typo can never become quiet access. `assistant/control/capabilities.py` is the
catalog; the Phase 2 integrations key off these exact strings.

**Permission** — access scoped to a resource, a set of actions, a task and an
expiry. Grants are released automatically when their task finishes. An agent
never receives one as a side effect of asking: it holds a permission or it
holds nothing.

**Approval** — a consequential action held until the user decides. Requesting
one moves the task to `waiting_approval`; approving resumes it, declining
cancels it. An approval that carries a capability *is* the held grant:
approving releases exactly that access, so the decision and the permission are
one event rather than two that can drift apart.

**Execution** — the control plane records steps; `TaskExecutor` runs them. It
hands each step to `ai_brain.run_task_step()`, which uses the same tools and
safety guard as the voice loop, then records the outcome on the step. Later
steps are told what earlier ones produced. The runner is injectable, so the
coordination logic is testable without a local model and a remote helper can
be substituted later.

**StepResult** — what a step produced: `ok`, `output`, `artifacts` and
`error`. Adapters may answer with plain text, which is normalised into one of
these, so the orchestrator handles one shape whether the work ran here or on
another machine. An agent that answers `ok: false` is retried like any other
failure.

**ActivityEvent** — one line of the timeline, in plain English. This is what
the System Log renders. It records observable actions only, never model
reasoning.

The message is for a person; the fields beside it are what a client filters
and groups on - `type`, `task_id`, `agent_id`, `capability`, `risk`,
`approval_id` and `result`. An approval's request and its answer carry the same
`approval_id`, so a client can join them without guessing.

## Using it from Python

```python
from assistant.control import get_control_plane

plane = get_control_plane()

plane.register_helper("Research helper", ["research", "web"])

task = plane.create_task(
    "Continue my Hackwave project",
    steps=["Finding relevant files", "Researching on the web", "Preparing the document"],
    capability="research",
)

plane.start_step(task.id, 0)
plane.finish_step(task.id, 0, "Found 3 matching documents")

plane.grant("Hackwave project", ["read", "write"], task_id=task.id, seconds=1800)

approval = plane.request_approval(
    action="Merge changes",
    question="I'm ready to merge your project changes.",
    reason="You asked me to finish the project",
    impact="14 files will change. All tests passed.",
    task_id=task.id,
)
plane.resolve_approval(approval.id, approved=True)

plane.complete_task(task.id, "Your project has been updated.")
```

## Asking for access

```python
result = plane.request_capability("google.gmail.send", task_id=task.id,
                                  agent_id="mail-agent")

result["status"]     # granted | waiting | denied
result["permission"] # the grant, when granted
result["approval"]   # what the user must answer, when waiting
result["judgement"]  # the decision, its risk level and why
```

Risk decides the default: low and medium run, high and critical ask. Stored
rules override that wherever the user has an opinion:

```python
plane.add_policy_rule("gcp.*", "deny", reason="No cloud from this machine.")
plane.add_policy_rule("google.gmail.send", "allow", task_id=task.id)
```

The narrowest matching rule wins — an exact capability beats a `google.*`
namespace, which beats `*` — and a deny beats an allow of equal narrowness, so
a broad permit never quietly re-enables something specifically forbidden. Rules
can also target one agent or one task.

| Risk | Examples | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `low` | `browser.navigate`, `web.search` | runs |
| `medium` | `google.drive.read`, `system.screen.read` | runs |
| `high` | `google.gmail.send`, `filesystem.write` | asks you |
| `critical` | `gcp.cloud_run.deploy`, `filesystem.delete` | asks you |

`TOOL_CAPABILITIES` maps the tools in `ai_brain.py` onto the same names, so the
voice path and an agent calling over HTTP are judged by one set of rules.

## Planning a goal

`Planner` turns a sentence into steps. The model call is injectable, so
planning is tested without a local model and swapped later without touching
the orchestrator:

```python
executor.start("Summarise my notes")        # plans, then runs
```

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8765/api/tasks/plan \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"goal": "Summarise my notes"}'    # steps, without committing to them

curl -X POST localhost:8765/api/tasks \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"goal": "Summarise my notes", "autoplan": true, "run": true}'
```

A dependency may only point backwards, so a bad plan cannot produce a cycle.
An unreadable answer, or an unreachable model, falls back to one step holding
the goal - planning never blocks the work.

## Running a task

`TaskExecutor` works the steps for you. It stops for a pending approval,
stops for an emergency stop, checkpoints after every step, and records an
honest failure with the real reason rather than a silent success.

```python
from assistant.control import get_executor

executor = get_executor()

task = executor.start(
    "Summarise my notes",
    steps=["Reading notes", "Writing the summary"],
)

executor.wait(task.id, timeout=120)   # optional; work runs in the background
```

Over HTTP:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8765/api/tasks \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"goal": "Summarise my notes", "steps": ["Reading notes"], "run": true}'
```

Work runs on background threads. `POST /api/tasks/{id}/cancel` and an
emergency stop interrupt a running step rather than waiting for it: the step
carries a cancel token that the agent loop checks between tool calls, and the
step is then recorded as stopped part-way.

### When something goes wrong

A failed step is tried again - three attempts by default, backing off between
them - because most failures here are a busy model or a flaky network rather
than a wrong plan. Attempts are counted on the step and the retry is announced
("That didn't work. Trying 'Searching' again."), so a retry is visible rather
than hidden. Cancellation is never retried.

If a task was still running when the process stopped, nothing marks it failed
on the way down - the process may have been killed - so it is found on the way
back up instead:

```python
executor.resume_interrupted()      # or POST /api/tasks/resume
```

Finished steps are never redone. The graph already records what was done, so
resuming starts at the first step that is not finished.

### Handing work to another agent

A step can pass part of its work to an agent better suited to it, without
starting a second task:

```python
plane.delegate(task.id, "Extracting the payment date", capability="documents")
```

The new step joins the same graph, waits for whatever is still unfinished
unless told otherwise, and runs through its own agent's adapter. One goal keeps
one timeline, one set of approvals and one summary.

### Capabilities are enforced, not just brokered

While a step runs, every tool it calls is checked against the catalog. A tool
with no capability behind it runs; a tool whose capability is already granted
runs; anything else goes through the broker, and the model is told why it was
refused:

```
Not allowed: google.gmail.send needs your approval first.
```

This is what makes `request_capability` more than advice. `TOOL_CAPABILITIES`
in `capabilities.py` is the mapping.

## Secrets

An agent that has to send mail is given `secret://email_app_password`, not the
password. The reference is resolved inside the control plane at the moment the
tool runs, so the credential never enters the model's context, the timeline,
the logs or an API response.

```bash
curl -X PUT localhost:8765/api/secrets/email_app_password \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"value": "hunter2", "description": "Gmail app password"}'

curl localhost:8765/api/secrets
# [{"name": "email_app_password", "reference": "secret://email_app_password", ...}]
```

There is no endpoint that returns a value - not for a client, not for an
agent. `plane.secrets.reveal()` exists for the control plane alone.

Values are encrypted with a key that lives outside the database: the
`JARVIS_SECRET_KEY` environment variable if set, otherwise `data/secret.key`,
created `0600` on first use. Copying `control.db` does not copy the ability to
read what is in it. Back the key up separately - without it the stored
credentials cannot be recovered.

As a last line of defence, `record()` redacts any stored value that appears in
a timeline message, replacing it with its reference. Nothing should ever put a
value there; anything this catches is a bug that would otherwise reach a log or
a phone.

To move the credentials currently sitting in `config.json`:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8765/api/secrets/import-config
```

That stores each one and leaves `secret://<name>` behind in the config file.

## Running the API

```bash
python -m assistant.api                 # localhost only (default)
python -m assistant.api --host 0.0.0.0  # reachable from a phone
python -m assistant.api --port 8765
```

Interactive documentation is generated at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/docs`.

> Binding to `0.0.0.0` lets anything on your network control this computer.
> It is opt-in and logs a warning on startup. Remote clients must pair first.

On startup it prints the addresses a phone or another computer can use, and the
command that shows a pairing code. `docs/mobile.md` walks through connecting a
phone.

## Pairing a device

Reaching the port is not the same as being allowed to use it. Every remote
client is a paired device holding its own token, and one token can be revoked
without disturbing the others.

```bash
# On the computer itself:
python -m assistant.api --pair
# or, equivalently, from an already paired device:
curl -X POST localhost:8765/api/pair/code
# {"code": "418302", "expires_in": 600}

# From the phone, once:
curl -X POST http://<computer>:8765/api/pair \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"code": "418302", "name": "My phone", "kind": "phone"}'
# {"device": {...}, "token": "..."}   <- shown once, never again

# Every call after that:
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' http://<computer>:8765/api/status

# WebSockets carry the same authority, so they authenticate too:
ws://<computer>:8765/ws/activity?token=<token>
```

Only the SHA-256 hash of a token is stored, so the database is not a list of
working credentials. `DELETE /api/devices/{id}/token` revokes one device.

Callers from this machine are trusted without a token by default, which keeps
the desktop app working. Three settings in `config.json` control this:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `api_require_auth` | `true` | Demand a token from anyone not trusted. |
| `api_trust_localhost` | `true` | Treat callers on this machine as authorised. |
| `api_rate_limit_per_minute` | `120` | Requests allowed per device per minute. |

Going over the limit returns `429` with a `Retry-After` header.

## Errors

Every failure uses one envelope, so no client special-cases anything:

```json
{"error": {"status": 404, "kind": "not_found", "message": "No such task."}}
```

`kind` is one of `bad_request`, `unauthenticated`, `forbidden`, `not_found`,
`conflict`, `invalid_request`, `rate_limited`, `internal_error`. A `422` also
carries `fields`, naming what was wrong.

| `PUT` | `/api/secrets/{name}` | Store or replace a credential. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/secrets/{name}` | Forget a credential. |
| `POST` | `/api/secrets/import-config` | Move credentials out of `config.json`. |
| `POST` | `/api/emergency-stop` | Stop work and revoke all access. |
| `POST` | `/api/resume` | Accept work again. |
| `WS` | `/ws/activity` | Live activity stream. |
| `WS` | `/ws/events` | Live events, filterable by type and task. |
| `WS` | `/ws/notifications` | Only what needs a person. |

### Events and notifications

Three sockets, all authenticated the same way:

| Socket | Carries |
| --- | --- |
| `/ws/activity` | Every event, with the last 25 on connect. The original stream. |
| `/ws/events` | Every event, filterable: `?types=task_failed,approval_requested&task_id=...` |
| `/ws/notifications` | Only what is worth interrupting a person for. |

The timeline records everything. A notification is different: it goes to a
phone that may be in someone's pocket, so the bar is higher. `notifier.py`
sends approvals waiting on you, work that finished or failed, an agent that
went wrong, and security events - and nothing else. Each one carries an
urgency (`action`, `problem`, `security`, `done`) and says whether it needs an
answer.

Channels are injectable. A phone on `/ws/notifications` is one; Telegram is
another, off unless `notify_telegram` is set in `config.json`. A channel that
throws is logged and skipped: a phone that is off must never stop the work.

`GET /api/notifications` returns the recent ones, so a client that reconnects
catches up. `GET /api/event-types` lists every type a client can filter on.

### Live activity

`/ws/activity` sends the 25 most recent events on connect so a client opens
with context, then pushes new events as they happen.

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket("ws://127.0.0.1:8765/ws/activity");
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const activity = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log(activity.timestamp, activity.message);
};
```

A slow client is never allowed to stall the control plane: its queue is
bounded and events are dropped rather than buffered without limit.

## Emergency stop

`POST /api/emergency-stop` cancels active tasks, revokes every temporary
permission, declines pending approvals and releases busy helpers. It then
latches: new tasks are refused with `409` until `POST /api/resume`.

It never deletes user data. History stays intact so the user can see what was
stopped.

## Schema migrations

`store.py` owns an ordered, named migration list and a `schema_version` table.
Schema changes go there rather than into `SCHEMA`, so an existing
`data/control.db` is upgraded in place instead of quietly missing columns.
Names are permanent: never renumber or reorder them.

## Design decisions

- **SQLite, not PostgreSQL.** No server to run. Storage is isolated in
  `store.py`, so swapping it later touches one file.
- **Dataclasses, not ORM models.** The model crosses SQLite, JSON and the
  event bus without dragging a framework along.
- **Synchronous core, async only at the edge.** The control plane is
  thread-safe and callable from anywhere; only the WebSocket handler is async.
- **Failures are recorded honestly.** `fail_task` stores the real reason. The
  timeline never claims something worked when it did not.

## Limitations

These are known gaps, not oversights:

- **Tokens do not expire.** A paired device stays paired until it is revoked.
  There is no refresh or rotation yet.
- **Rate limiting is per process.** Restarting the API resets every bucket.
- **Notifications are not delivered while nothing is connected.** There is no
  push service; a phone with no socket open sees them only when it asks for
  recent notifications, or through Telegram if that is switched on.
- **Notification history is in memory.** It does not survive a restart, unlike
  the timeline, which does.
- **A remote agent cannot resolve a secret.** References are resolved for
  in-process tools only; an HTTP agent that needs a credential has no way to
  ask for one yet.
- **Secrets are not capability-scoped.** Any step that can call a tool can use
  any stored secret; there is no per-secret policy rule.
- **Enforcement covers the tools JARVIS knows.** A tool missing from
  `TOOL_CAPABILITIES` is treated as needing no capability, so new tools must be
  added there as they are written.
- **Agent selection is a first match, not a scheduler.** It prefers idle then
  least-recently-used. There is no load balancing or cost awareness.
- **Health is swept on read, not by a timer.** An agent flips to `offline` the
  next time agents, devices or status are listed, not the moment it goes quiet.
- **Agents are not authenticated separately.** An agent calls through a paired
  device's token; there is no per-agent credential yet.
- **A running step is interrupted between tool calls, not inside one.** A tool
  that has already started - a long shell command - finishes before the step
  notices it was stopped.
- **A failed step fails the task once its retries are used up.** There is no
  alternative branch and no replanning around the failure.
- **Resuming is not automatic.** `POST /api/tasks/resume` or
  `executor.resume_interrupted()` has to be called on startup; nothing runs it
  for you yet.
- **Agents are selected but not marked busy.** Execution does not yet set an
  agent to `working` or release it afterwards.
- **A resumed task stays with its own agent.** Recovery restarts the unfinished
  steps; it does not move them to a different agent.
- **Permission expiry is checked on read**, not by a background timer. A grant
  stops authorising the moment it lapses, but its stored status only flips to
  `expired` the next time permissions are listed or checked.

## Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

324 tests cover the task lifecycle, capability matching, permission expiry and
revocation, the approval flow, emergency stop, step execution, failure and
cancellation paths, pairing and token authentication, rate limiting, schema
migrations, the capability catalog, policy precedence, the broker's grant,
hold and refuse paths, agent registration, heartbeats and staleness, the kill
switch, the HTTP and native adapters, planning and its fallbacks, the step
graph and its parallelism, cancellation part-way through a step, capability
enforcement at the call site, retries and their cap, resuming interrupted work
without redoing it, delegation between agents, typed lifecycle events and their
audit fields, notification routing including a channel that throws, secret
storage, resolution, redaction and key handling, and the HTTP and WebSocket
surface. The executor tests use an
injected runner, so none of them need Ollama.
